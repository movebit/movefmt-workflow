To use this workflow in your Move project:

```yaml
name: MoveFmt CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  format-check:
    uses: movebit/movefmt-workflow/.github/workflows/format-check.yml@main
    with:
      path: "."  # optional: directory to check format in
```

### 2. What it does
